Operating Platforms


The Gaming Room is the creator of an android application, Draw It or Lose it, which plays similarly to the Win, Lose, or Draw television game show from the 1980s. The client wishes to expand their offerings, allowing the game to be played on multiple platforms over a distributed system. They have requested a review of traditional and mobile operating platforms to determine the best way to develop across all of them and nail down the requirements for doing so. 

The initial parts of this document were my strong point. I was able to easily understand and express what was expected of me and the requirements as well as the the design constraints for developing this application. Working through the design document helped me to understand the project as a whole better as well as the nuances behind developing for each system. If I could revise anything from this document, it would likely be the development requirements table. I could surely be more concise in my wording and probably narrow some parts down to what would actually be useful and not just possible as far as available options for the different platforms. 

However, creating this table, along with working on the design document as a whole, helped me to narrow down my options and make recommendations for the application. It is important to consider user needs in the design because there isn't a one size fits all solution to software development. Efficiency isn't the only metric by which we measure what system is "best", and other factors will need to be considered when developing an application that fits the user's specific needs.

I approached this document ready to learn. Prior to this class there was a lot I didn't know about different operating systems and their architectures. I would like to think that given what I have learned here the process may go a bit smoother the next time. In a real world scenario, I would also like to believe I'd have some sort of route to contact the client in order to hammer out some extra details and follow up to improve the requirements to better suit their needs.
